The Nokia MixRadio SDK (formerly know as the Nokia Music SDK) lets you easily integrate your Windows Phone with Nokia MixRadio on Nokia Lumia phones or your Windows Store app with Nokia MixRadio for Windows 8.

The SDK offers two levels of integration; the simplest and quickest to get going is to use the high-level Launcher Tasks,
with more advanced integration available to perform searches and get recommendations within your app.

Please link back to Nokia MixRadio from your app!
